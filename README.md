# The impact of Sixth Men

In this notebook, I am doing an in depth study of the sixth men (and bench players) from the year 1999-2023. I take a look at the different positions, ages, and statistical contributions of these players to look for trends, as well as trends in how their teams played. This data will be presented to the NC State Sports Analytics Club, and I had a great time with this. I think I will begin a blog and start posting different sports analysis projects biweekly. 


## Project Content
For all of these, I provide cell by cell analysis, so you can just read along!  
- Descriptive Statistics: Overview of basic statistics and trends (analysis/descriptive_Statistics.ipynb).
- Association Mining: Advanced analysis on patterns and associations in the data (analysis/association_mining.ipynb).
- Visualizations: File storing all the visualizations used for descriptive statistics and association mining (analysis/visualizations).

## Data
If you want to play around with the raw and processed data:  
Combined Data: Look in data/rawDataProcessing/combined for CSV files containing combined player and team data per 100 possessions.
Seasonal Data: Individual season data can be found in data/data_per_game, data/per_100_poss, and data/team_per_100.  
These files are already in CSV format, so all you have to do is download the csv file of your choice. 

## methodology
I used Python with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and techniques like association rule learning for discovering relationships within the data.
