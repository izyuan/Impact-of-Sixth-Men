    "<li>PIE Scores </li> As we can see, the PIE scores of the players from 2010-2023 were higher than the PIE scores from the earlier generation. This could be to a variety of factors, but my guess is because the sixth men have become more and more specialized, and teams have learned to utilize these players better. \n",
    "For example, a player like Kyle Korver is very specialized in shooting threes. Teams will adapt to fit his playstyle, giving him a higher ORtg and PIE score. \n",
    "<li>Minutes</li> The minutes actually decreased from the first time period to the second period. This is very interesting because the efficiencies and PIE scores both increased. I think this has shown how basketball has really developed. \n",
    "<li>age</li> There was a slight decrease in age, but I think this is just because there is more and more young players in the NBA. \n",

    "\n",
    "Centers have seen a marked increase in their average PIE scores from 1999-2010 to 2011-2023, suggesting their roles have grown in importance despite their lower presence on the court. Power forwards and point guards also show increased PIE scores, indicating their sustained or enhanced impact in games. Conversely, small forwards have experienced a slight decrease in PIE scores, potentially reflecting changes in their traditional roles or an overlap with shooting guards, who have remained relatively stable in their impact. The data suggests that as the NBA has evolved, so too has the contribution of each position, with a clear trend towards valuing efficiency and versatility.\n"
