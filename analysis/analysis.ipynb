Association Rules Mining: Explore the relationship between team success and the characteristics of its sixth man using association rules mining.e.g. \"Teams with sixth men aged over 30 and with a PIE above X tend to finish in the top Y%.\" 2. Cluster Analysis: Perform cluster analysis to segment sixth men into distinct groups based on multiple factors like PIE, age, minutes played, and team performance. This could reveal unique profiles of sixth men, such as high-impact veterans or efficient young talents.\n",
